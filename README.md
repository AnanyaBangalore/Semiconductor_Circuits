# Semiconductor_Circuits
My laboratory materials for semiconductor circuits are stored in this repository. The documents contain schematics, circuit designs, and simulation data that I produced as part of my study.

Each lab file is associated with a particular Semiconductor circuit and contains a concise explanation of the circuit's design, operation, and analysis. The files are arranged by lab session and include a variety of subjects, such as operational amplifiers, transistors, and diodes.

In general, the lab materials offer a thorough introduction to semiconductor circuits and show how to use them in real-world scenarios. Students and amateurs interested in analogue electronics and circuit design can use them.
